# Datadog GCP Integration

You are helping a user set up the Datadog GCP integration using Terraform.

The integration creates a GCP service account in the customer's project and grants Datadog's delegate principal
the ability to impersonate it via `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`. This avoids long-lived keys entirely.

This is a hands-on setup: run the commands yourself as part of the conversation rather than handing the
user a list, keep them in the loop, and pause for confirmation before `terraform apply`.

## Phase 0: Preflight

**Terraform or OpenTofu.** Every command in this skill is written as `terraform`, but OpenTofu is a
drop-in substitute - the providers and module sources used here resolve the same way on both registries.
Check which binary the user actually has before Phase 1:

```bash
command -v terraform tofu
```

If only `tofu` is on the PATH, read every `terraform <subcommand>` below as `tofu <subcommand>`. If both
are present, ask which one the user wants rather than guessing.

**Datadog credentials.** Load `DD_SITE` / `DD_API_KEY` / `DD_APP_KEY` from the environment (falling back
to `.env.local` / `.env`) and validate both keys - they fail independently:

```bash
for f in .env.local .env; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; for k in DD_SITE DD_API_KEY DD_APP_KEY; do eval "[ -n \"\${$k:-}\" ]" && continue; v=$(grep -E "^$k=" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^["'\'']//;s/["'\'']$//'); [ -n "$v" ] && export "$k=$v"; done; done
: "${DD_SITE:=datadoghq.com}"
echo "DD_SITE=${DD_SITE}"
echo "DD_API_KEY=$([ -n "${DD_API_KEY:-}" ] && echo set || echo UNSET)   DD_APP_KEY=$([ -n "${DD_APP_KEY:-}" ] && echo set || echo UNSET)"
printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" \
  | curl -sS --max-time 20 -o /dev/null -w "validate:     HTTP %{http_code}\n" \
      -H @- "https://api.${DD_SITE}/api/v1/validate"
printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\nDD-APPLICATION-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" "$DD_APP_KEY" \
  | curl -sS --max-time 20 -o /dev/null -w "current_user: HTTP %{http_code}\n" \
      -H @- "https://api.${DD_SITE}/api/v2/current_user"
```

| Result | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Both `200` | Keys are good for this site | Continue to Phase 1 |
| `validate` is `403` | The **API key** is invalid, or belongs to a different region than `DD_SITE` | Ask which site the key belongs to, fix `DD_SITE`, re-check |
| `validate` `200`, `current_user` `403` | The **app key** is wrong or from another region - not the API key | Get one from `<APP_BASE>/organization-settings/application-keys` |
| Either key unset | Nothing to validate | On a commercial site, run the **dd-account-setup** skill, then come back. On `ddog-gov.com` or `us2.ddog-gov.com`, ask the user for the keys directly - that skill validates `DD_SITE` against a list that excludes both government sites and will reject them |

**App URL.** The Datadog app host is **not** `app.${DD_SITE}` for every site. It is
`https://app.datadoghq.com` (US1), `https://app.datadoghq.eu` (EU1), `https://app.ddog-gov.com` (Gov),
and for every other site it is `https://${DD_SITE}` itself - `https://us3.datadoghq.com`,
`https://us5.datadoghq.com`, `https://ap1.datadoghq.com`, `https://ap2.datadoghq.com`,
`https://uk1.datadoghq.com`. Resolve it once and substitute it wherever `<APP_BASE>` appears below.
Full list: https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/

**Remember the resolved `DD_SITE`.** Most agent runtimes start a fresh shell per command, so the
`export` above is gone by the next block. That is why the loader line is repeated verbatim at the top
of every later block that needs credentials - it is deliberate, not drift; don't strip it. `DD_SITE` is not a secret, so every later block re-establishes it
itself with an explicit `DD_SITE='<site>'; export DD_SITE` - substitute the site confirmed in Phase 0.
It is a plain assignment rather than `: "${DD_SITE:=...}"` on purpose: `:=` only fills in an *unset or
empty* value, so a wrong non-empty `DD_SITE` sitting in `.env` would survive it and every call would go to
the wrong region. The keys are guarded with `:?` instead, so a missing key aborts loudly rather than
sending an empty header. **Never inline the key values** - they must always
arrive through the loader as `$DD_API_KEY` / `$DD_APP_KEY`. Two consequences follow, and both are
deliberate:

- **Datadog calls pass headers on stdin**, as `printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" | curl -H @- ...`.
  `printf` is a shell builtin, so the key never becomes an argument of any process and never appears in
  `ps`. Writing `-H "DD-API-KEY: $DD_API_KEY"` instead would put it in curl's argv. (`-H @-` needs
  curl 7.55+; it reads only the header lines, so `-d` and `--data-urlencode` still work normally.)
- **Terraform never receives the keys as values at all** for AWS, Azure, and GCP: the Datadog provider
  reads `DD_API_KEY` / `DD_APP_KEY` from the environment, so there are no root variables, no `-var=`
  arguments, and nothing for Terraform to record in state or a saved plan. (OCI is the exception - its
  module needs them as inputs, so there they travel as `TF_VAR_*`.)

Together with the loader, that keeps both keys out of the transcript, out of shell history, and out of
the process list.

**Tools.** `terraform` is required, plus `jq` for Phase 1. The `gcloud` CLI is optional for discovery,
but the `google` provider needs ambient GCP credentials either way
(`gcloud auth application-default login`, or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`):

```bash
command -v terraform || echo "MISSING terraform - https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install"
command -v jq || echo "MISSING jq - needed to read the delegate email in Phase 1"
command -v gcloud >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "gcloud: available" || echo "gcloud: not installed"
```

If `jq` isn't available, read `data.attributes.delegate_account_email` out of the raw JSON response in
Phase 1 yourself instead of piping through `jq`.

**The snippets here are POSIX shell.** Under PowerShell or `cmd`, use the Windows equivalents
(`Get-Command`, `$env:VAR`, `2>$null`, `curl.exe`) - same calls, same order.

## Phase 1: Gather Datadog Delegate Principal

Datadog impersonates the customer's service account through a per-org delegate service account. Get its
email - **GET first**, and only POST if the org has no delegate yet, so an existing one is reused rather
than re-created:

```bash
for f in .env.local .env; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; for k in DD_SITE DD_API_KEY DD_APP_KEY; do eval "[ -n \"\${$k:-}\" ]" && continue; v=$(grep -E "^$k=" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^["'\'']//;s/["'\'']$//'); [ -n "$v" ] && export "$k=$v"; done; done
DD_SITE='datadoghq.com'; export DD_SITE   # <- replace with the site confirmed in Phase 0.
# Explicit assignment, not ':=': a wrong non-empty DD_SITE in .env would otherwise survive.
: "${DD_API_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"; : "${DD_APP_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"
resp=$(printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\nDD-APPLICATION-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" "$DD_APP_KEY" \
  | curl -sS -w '\n%{http_code}' -X GET \
      -H @- "https://api.${DD_SITE}/api/v2/integration/gcp/sts_delegate")
code=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | tail -1); body=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | sed '$d')
if [ "$code" = "404" ]; then
  echo "no delegate exists yet (HTTP 404) - creating one"
  resp=$(printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\nDD-APPLICATION-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" "$DD_APP_KEY" \
    | curl -sS -w '\n%{http_code}' -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' \
        -H @- "https://api.${DD_SITE}/api/v2/integration/gcp/sts_delegate")
  code=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | tail -1); body=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | sed '$d')
elif [ "$code" != "200" ]; then
  echo "GET sts_delegate returned HTTP $code - not creating anything. Response:"
  printf '%s\n' "$body"
  echo "403 means the app key lacks permission, 429 is rate limiting, 000 is a transport failure, 5xx is"
  echo "server-side. None of those mean 'no delegate exists', so a POST here could create one you did not"
  echo "intend. Resolve the error, then re-run. If the body says no delegate exists, POST explicitly."
  exit 1
fi
[ "$code" = "200" ] || { echo "sts_delegate failed with HTTP $code:"; printf '%s\n' "$body"; exit 1; }
email=$(printf '%s' "$body" | jq -r '.data.attributes.delegate_account_email // empty')
case "$email" in
  *@*.iam.gserviceaccount.com) echo "DATADOG_PRINCIPAL_ID=$email" ;;
  *) echo "did not get a delegate service-account email; response was:"; printf '%s\n' "$body"; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

Remember the printed email as `DATADOG_PRINCIPAL_ID` - the Terraform below needs it. It is org-specific
and cannot be hardcoded.

**Never continue on an empty or `null` email.** The guards above exist because `curl -s | jq -r` on an
error response prints `null`, which would silently become `member = "serviceAccount:null"` in the
Terraform and produce an integration that cannot authenticate.

If `jq` is unavailable, run the block exactly as written **except** the `email=$(... | jq -r ...)` line -
do not remove the `printf ... | curl -H @-` pipeline, which is what supplies authentication. Read
`data.attributes.delegate_account_email` out of `$body` yourself and apply the same rule: refuse to proceed
unless it looks like a `...@....iam.gserviceaccount.com` address.

## Phase 2: Determine Scope

Ask the user if they already know which GCP project IDs and/or folder IDs they want Datadog to monitor.

If they do, collect:
- Which GCP project should host the Datadog service account (the "host project")?
- The list of project IDs and/or folder IDs to monitor.

If they don't know or want help figuring it out:

**If the `gcloud` CLI is available**, offer to discover their GCP
environment. Explain that you will use `gcloud` to list their organizations, folders, and projects
so they can pick which ones to monitor. This is best-effort - run each command independently and
work with whatever succeeds:

**Organizations:**
```bash
gcloud organizations list --format="table(displayName, name)"
```

**Folders** (uses the REST API to search all active folders across the org; also requires `gcloud`
for the access token):
```bash
printf 'Authorization: Bearer %s\n' "$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
  | curl -sS -H @- -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"query": "lifecycleState=ACTIVE"}' \
      "https://cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/v2/folders:search"
```
If the response contains a `nextPageToken`, paginate by adding `"pageToken": "<token>"` to the request body
until all folders are retrieved.

**Expand nested folders yourself.** The search above returns every active folder in the org, so use it to
build the *full* descendant set for whatever the user picks: for each chosen folder, collect every folder
whose `parent` chain leads back to it, then list the projects of all of them:

```bash
# replace these with the chosen folder and every folder nested beneath it
set -- 123456789012 987654321098
for folder do
  gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id=${folder} AND lifecycleState=ACTIVE AND NOT projectId:sys*" \
    --format="value(projectId)"
done | sort -u
```

Put that expanded list into the Terraform's `project_ids` **in addition to** keeping the chosen folders in
`folder_ids`. The reason is in the template: folder-level IAM is inherited by every descendant project, but
API enablement is not, and the `google_projects` data source matches on immediate parent only. Folders in
`folder_ids` cover IAM (including projects created later); the expanded `project_ids` is what actually
enables the required APIs in each existing project. Skipping the expansion produces an integration that
looks configured but silently collects nothing from projects in sub-folders.

**Projects** (active only, excluding system projects):
```bash
gcloud projects list --filter="lifecycleState=ACTIVE AND NOT projectId:sys*" --format="table(projectId, name, parent.id)"
```

If any individual command fails (e.g., the user lacks permission to list organizations or folders),
inform the user which command failed and why, but continue with whatever information was
successfully retrieved. For example, if they can list projects but not folders, proceed with
project-level setup.

**Otherwise** (`gcloud` not installed or not authenticated), ask the user to gather the IDs from
the GCP Console:
- **Project IDs**: console.cloud.google.com → project picker (top bar) → each project's ID is shown
  next to its name.
- **Folder IDs** (optional): console.cloud.google.com → **IAM & Admin** → **Manage Resources** →
  expand the org tree; folder IDs are visible in the resource manager.
- **Every project inside those folders, including nested sub-folders** - expand the whole subtree in
  **Manage Resources** and collect each project ID. This is not optional busywork: the Terraform enables
  the required APIs per project, so any project you don't list gets folder-inherited IAM and no API
  enablement, and collects nothing. If the user won't enumerate them, tell them folder-scoped setup needs
  `gcloud` (which can expand the subtree automatically) and offer project-scoped setup instead.
- **Host project**: ask which project the Datadog service account should live in.

Present whatever results were gathered in a readable format and let the user choose:
- **Specific projects**: list of project IDs
- **Folders**: list of folder IDs (Datadog will discover all active projects within them)
- **Both**: a combination of explicit projects and folders

Then ask which project should host the Datadog service account.

## Phase 3: Generate and Apply Terraform

### Check what already exists - local Terraform first, then Datadog

Do this **before** generating or applying anything, and in this order. Local state first, because it
decides whether an existing integration is something you can update or something you must not touch:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name '*.tf' -o -name 'terraform.tfstate' \) -print
# A project is "present" if it has configuration - .terraform/ may simply not exist yet on a fresh clone
# with a remote backend, and terraform.tfstate does not exist at all when state is remote.
if [ -n "$(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name '*.tf' -o -name '*.tf.json' \) -print -quit)" ]; then
  terraform init -input=false >/dev/null || { echo "terraform init failed - resolve that before concluding anything about existing state"; exit 1; }
  out=$(terraform state list 2>&1); rc=$?
  if [ "$rc" -ne 0 ]; then
    case $out in
      *'No state file'*|*'no state'*|*'Backend initialization required'*)
        echo "project is initialized but has no state yet - treat as a clean install" ;;
      *)
        printf '%s\n' "$out"
        echo "could not read state (backend or credentials problem) - do NOT treat this as 'nothing exists'"; exit 1 ;;
    esac
  elif [ -z "$out" ]; then
    echo "state is empty - treat as a clean install"
  else
    printf '%s\n' "$out" | grep -F 'datadog_integration_gcp_sts' || echo "state exists but holds no datadog_integration_gcp_sts resource"
  fi
else
  echo "no Terraform configuration here yet - clean install"
fi
```

Match the **exact** resource address `datadog_integration_gcp_sts`, not a loose `grep -i datadog`: unrelated Datadog
resources, or cloud IAM left behind by a partial apply, would otherwise read as a managed integration.

Then ask Datadog what it already has:

```bash
for f in .env.local .env; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; for k in DD_SITE DD_API_KEY DD_APP_KEY; do eval "[ -n \"\${$k:-}\" ]" && continue; v=$(grep -E "^$k=" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^["'\'']//;s/["'\'']$//'); [ -n "$v" ] && export "$k=$v"; done; done
DD_SITE='datadoghq.com'; export DD_SITE   # <- replace with the site confirmed in Phase 0.
# Explicit assignment, not ':=': a wrong non-empty DD_SITE in .env would otherwise survive.
: "${DD_API_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"; : "${DD_APP_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"
resp=$(printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\nDD-APPLICATION-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" "$DD_APP_KEY" \
  | curl -sS -w '\n%{http_code}' -X GET -H @- "https://api.${DD_SITE}/api/v2/integration/gcp/accounts")
code=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | tail -1); body=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | sed '$d')
[ "$code" = "200" ] || { echo "lookup failed with HTTP $code - do not assume 'not connected':"; printf '%s\n' "$body"; exit 1; }
printf '%s\n' "$body"
```

Now reconcile the two answers before doing anything:

- **Not in Datadog, nothing in local state** - a clean install. Continue.
- **In Datadog *and* present in local state** - this is the update/repair case, not a duplicate.
  Continue into the Terraform below as a change to the existing resources, and let the plan show
  what it will alter.
- **In Datadog but *absent* from local state** (a service account for the host project from Phase 2 is already registered) - stop. Applying would either create a
  duplicate or fight with whatever manages it. Say so plainly and offer the options: import the existing
  object into this project (`terraform import datadog_integration_gcp_sts.datadog_integration "<integration-uuid>"` - the uuid
  comes from `GET /api/v2/integration/gcp/accounts`, not the project id or service-account email), manage it where it is already managed, or delete it in Datadog first.
  Only continue if the user picks one and confirms.
  Two things about importing, in this order. **Generate the configuration first** (the Terraform below,
  adapted to the identity that already exists - same role/app/service-account name), because `terraform
  import` binds an existing object to a *configured* resource address and fails without one. And importing
  the Datadog registration alone is not enough: the cloud-side identity (the IAM role, the app registration,
  the service account) is still outside state, so either import those too or reference them with data
  sources, or the next apply will try to create them again and collide.

   ```bash
   # the uuid comes from the accounts listing, not the project id or service-account email
   terraform import datadog_integration_gcp_sts.datadog_integration "<integration-uuid>"
   ```
- **Present in local state but *absent* from Datadog** - a partial or rolled-back install. The cloud-side
  resources may exist while the registration does not. Do not start from scratch: run the plan and let it
  show what is missing, and expect it to re-create only the registration.

### Check for Existing Terraform

Before generating a new Terraform configuration, check if the user already has a Terraform project
in the current directory or nearby:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f \( -name '*.tf' -o -name 'terraform.tfstate' \) -print
```

**If existing `.tf` files are found:**
- Read them to understand what providers and resources are already configured.
- If a `datadog` provider already exists, reuse its configuration - do not create a duplicate.
- If a `google` provider already exists, reuse it.
- Only add the **new resources** needed (service account, IAM bindings, `datadog_integration_gcp_sts`)
  to the existing project. Do not regenerate providers, variables, or terraform blocks that
  already exist.
- If the user has a modular layout, create a new file like `datadog-gcp-integration.tf` for the
  Datadog resources.

**If no existing Terraform is found**, generate a standalone configuration.

The full HCL template - providers, API enablement, the service account, the token-creator binding for
Datadog's delegate, the project and folder role bindings, and the `datadog_integration_gcp_sts`
registration - is in **`references/terraform.md`**, along with the projects-only and folders-only
variants. Read it now and emit it with the placeholders filled in.

## Applying the Terraform

1. Replace all `<PLACEHOLDER>` values in the template with the actual values gathered:
   - `<USER_FOLDER_IDS>` and `<USER_PROJECT_IDS>` from Phase 2
   - `<HOST_PROJECT_ID>` from Phase 2
   - `<DATADOG_PRINCIPAL_ID>` from Phase 1
   - `<DD_SITE>` from Phase 0
2. If the user selected only projects (no folders), remove the `folder_ids` local, the `google_projects.folder_projects` data source, the `google_folder_iam_member` resource, and simplify `all_project_ids` to just `local.project_ids`.
3. If the user selected only folders (no explicit projects), **still put the expanded descendant project
   list from Phase 2 into `project_ids`** - do not set it to `[]`. `folder_ids` grants IAM (and covers
   projects created later), but API enablement is per-project, so an empty `project_ids` leaves every
   existing project in those folders without the required APIs.
4. Run `terraform init` to install providers.
5. Plan, and **save the plan to a file**. The Datadog provider reads `DD_API_KEY` / `DD_APP_KEY`
   straight from the environment, so there are no root variables and no `-var=` arguments - nothing secret
   ends up in the plan file, in state, or on a command line:

   ```bash
   for f in .env.local .env; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; for k in DD_SITE DD_API_KEY DD_APP_KEY; do eval "[ -n \"\${$k:-}\" ]" && continue; v=$(grep -E "^$k=" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^["'\'']//;s/["'\'']$//'); [ -n "$v" ] && export "$k=$v"; done; done
   DD_SITE='datadoghq.com'; export DD_SITE   # <- replace with the site confirmed in Phase 0.
   # Explicit assignment, not ':=': a wrong non-empty DD_SITE in .env would otherwise survive.
   : "${DD_API_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"; : "${DD_APP_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"
   umask 077          # tighten permissions on the plan file anyway
   terraform plan -out=tfplan
   ```

   Show the plan output to the user and wait for explicit confirmation.
6. Apply **that saved plan**, only after the user confirms it. Applying the file is what makes the
   approval meaningful: `terraform apply` with no plan file computes a brand-new plan, and `-auto-approve`
   would execute it without anyone seeing it, so anything changed since the plan would go in unreviewed:

   ```bash
   for f in .env.local .env; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; for k in DD_SITE DD_API_KEY DD_APP_KEY; do eval "[ -n \"\${$k:-}\" ]" && continue; v=$(grep -E "^$k=" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^["'\'']//;s/["'\'']$//'); [ -n "$v" ] && export "$k=$v"; done; done
   DD_SITE='datadoghq.com'; export DD_SITE   # <- replace with the site confirmed in Phase 0.
   # Explicit assignment, not ':=': a wrong non-empty DD_SITE in .env would otherwise survive.
   : "${DD_API_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"; : "${DD_APP_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"
   trap 'rm -f tfplan' EXIT HUP INT TERM   # the plan file goes away even if this is interrupted
   if terraform apply tfplan; then
     echo "apply complete"
   else
     echo "terraform apply FAILED - do NOT verify or report success"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

   The `trap` removes the plan file on every exit path, including Ctrl-C while the user is deciding. The
   `if`/`else` around the apply matters because a cleanup command as the block's last line would make a
   failed apply exit 0, and the agent would go on to "verify" a deployment that never happened. (It is an
   `if` rather than `status=$?` on purpose: `status` is a read-only variable in zsh.)

   The plan file holds no key material at all, because the keys never become Terraform values - the provider
   reads them from the environment. That is what makes `-out` safe here, on any Terraform version, and it is
   why an existing project needs no variable changes either.

7. After `terraform apply` succeeds, verify the integration registered with Datadog:

   ```bash
   for f in .env.local .env; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; for k in DD_SITE DD_API_KEY DD_APP_KEY; do eval "[ -n \"\${$k:-}\" ]" && continue; v=$(grep -E "^$k=" "$f" | head -1 | cut -d= -f2- | sed 's/^["'\'']//;s/["'\'']$//'); [ -n "$v" ] && export "$k=$v"; done; done
   DD_SITE='datadoghq.com'; export DD_SITE   # <- replace with the site confirmed in Phase 0.
   # Explicit assignment, not ':=': a wrong non-empty DD_SITE in .env would otherwise survive.
   : "${DD_API_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"; : "${DD_APP_KEY:?not set - run dd-account-setup (commercial sites) or supply it directly (government sites)}"
   resp=$(printf 'DD-API-KEY: %s\nDD-APPLICATION-KEY: %s\n' "$DD_API_KEY" "$DD_APP_KEY" \
     | curl -sS -w '\n%{http_code}' -X GET -H @- "https://api.${DD_SITE}/api/v2/integration/gcp/accounts")
   code=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | tail -1); body=$(printf '%s' "$resp" | sed '$d')
   [ "$code" = "200" ] || { echo "lookup failed with HTTP $code - do not assume 'not connected':"; printf '%s\n' "$body"; exit 1; }
   printf '%s\n' "$body"
   ```

   Confirm the response includes the service account email just provisioned. If it's missing, surface the response to the user so they can debug.

## Getting the Most Out of Your Integration

Once `terraform apply` completes successfully, congratulate the user and let them know metrics typically
arrive within 5-10 minutes. Then check for early metrics and show a widget.

### Checking for Metrics

Give it a few seconds, then make a single query to the metrics API - substitute a project you actually put in
monitoring scope for `<MONITORED_PROJECT_ID>` - not necessarily the host project, which the template

### Rendering the Widget

**If the `series` array is non-empty**, render an ASCII chart from the real data:
- Use the `pointlist` values to plot the line, scaling Y-axis to actual min/max.
- Use box-drawing characters (`╭`, `╰`, `─`, `│`, `┤`) for the line.
- List the instance names from each series `scope` at the bottom.
- Show the top 3 series by average value if multiple are returned.

**If the `series` array is empty**, show this static preview instead and let the user know
metrics are still propagating:

    Metrics Explorer: <APP_BASE>/metric/explorer?exp_metric=gcp.gce.instance.cpu.utilization

Confirm to the user that their integration is configured and data will appear shortly. All links use `DD_SITE` - construct them as `<APP_BASE>/...`.

- **GCP Integration tile**: `<APP_BASE>/integrations/google-cloud-platform` - access the pre-built dashboard and verify the integration is active.
- **Metrics Explorer**: `<APP_BASE>/metric/explorer?exp_metric=gcp.gce.instance.cpu.utilization` - confirm data is flowing.
- Each GCP sub-integration (Cloud SQL, Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, GKE, etc.) has its own dashboard that activates automatically when metrics for that service are detected.

**Recommended Monitors** - suggest creating monitors for common GCP health signals at `<APP_BASE>/monitors/create`:
- Compute Engine CPU exceeding a threshold
- Cloud SQL connection counts approaching limits
- GKE nodes entering NotReady state
- Pub/Sub dead-letter queue growth

**If resource collection was enabled:**
- **Resource Catalog**: `<APP_BASE>/infrastructure/catalog` - browse Compute instances, Cloud SQL databases, GKE clusters, and more.
- **Infrastructure Map**: `<APP_BASE>/infrastructure/map` - visualize GCP infrastructure.

**Explore more Datadog products:**
- **Log Management**: `<APP_BASE>/logs` - stream GCP logs for centralized search and alerting. Setup: https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/google_cloud_platform/#log-collection
- **APM & Traces**: `<APP_BASE>/apm/getting-started` - distributed tracing for applications on Cloud Run, GKE, or Compute Engine.
- **Notebooks**: `<APP_BASE>/notebook` - shareable investigations combining metrics, logs, and events.

## Important Notes

- Always confirm project IDs, folder IDs, and the host project with the user before generating Terraform.
- The user needs permission to create service accounts, enable services, and set IAM policy on every
  project and folder in scope: `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin` /
  `roles/resourcemanager.folderIamAdmin`, `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` on the host project, and
  `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on every project where the config enables an API (the host
  project included - it gets `iam.googleapis.com` and `iamcredentials.googleapis.com`).
  `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`, which the service account itself receives, is not enough to
  *enable* an API.
- The Datadog delegate principal ID is org-specific and must be fetched from the API - it cannot be hardcoded.
- The Datadog API and app keys are never passed to Terraform as values: the `datadog` provider reads
  `DD_API_KEY` and `DD_APP_KEY` from the environment, so there are no root variables, no `-var=` arguments,
  and nothing for Terraform to record in state or a saved plan. Don't declare key variables, and don't
  write the keys into a committed `.tfvars` file or any other persistent file.
- Never run `terraform apply` without showing the plan to the user first.
